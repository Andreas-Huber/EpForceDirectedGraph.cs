EpForceDirectedGraph.cs
=======================
#### A 2D/3D force directed graph algorithm in C# ####


Introduction
------------
This project was started after I was inspired by [Springy by Dennis Hotson](https://github.com/dhotson/springy) and [the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing).
It comes along with a demo to show how the agorithm execute as similar to Dennis Hotson's [Online Demo](http://dhotson.github.io/springy/demo-simple.html). (Currently working on it...)
